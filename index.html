    <p>
      <span>Constructed in 1889 as the enterance of the World's Fair the Eiffel Tower</span>
      <span>is a world icon for France sitting in the center of Paris. Engineer Gustave Eiffel</span>
      <span>designed it as a wrought iron lattice tower and it was initially criticized for</span>
      <span>its design. It has turned out to be the most visited paid monument in the world </span>
      <span>with about 7 million visitors.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Standing at 1,063 ft tall it is by far the tallest structure in Paris.</span>
      <span>Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has been the site of numerous high-profile stunts,</span>
      <span>ceremonial events and even scientific experiments. In 1911, for instance, the German</span>
      <span>physicist Theodor Wulf used an electrometer to detect higher levels of radiation at</span>
      <span>its top than at its base, observing the effects of what are now called cosmic rays.</span>
      <span>The Eiffel Tower has also inspired more than 30 replicas and similar structures in</span>
      <span>various cities around the world.</span>
