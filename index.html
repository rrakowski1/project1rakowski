    <p>
      Constructed in 1889 as the enterance of the World's Fair the Eiffel Tower
      is a world icon for France sitting in the center of Paris. Engineer Gustave Eiffel
      designed it as a wrought iron lattice tower and it was initially criticized for
      its design. It has turned out to be the most visited paid monument in the world
      with about 7 million visitors.

      Standing at 1,063 ft tall it is by far the tallest structure in Paris.
      Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has been the site of numerous high-profile stunts,
      ceremonial events and even scientific experiments. In 1911, for instance, the German
      physicist Theodor Wulf used an electrometer to detect higher levels of radiation at
      its top than at its base, observing the effects of what are now called cosmic rays.
      The Eiffel Tower has also inspired more than 30 replicas and similar structures in
      various cities around the world.
